# Vantage-Gadgets-Executive-Profitability-Dashboard
This project is a high-fidelity E-commerce Executive Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel. It transforms raw order, product, and marketing data into a strategic tool for identifying "Money Pit" SKUs and optimizing advertising spend.

The dashboard provides a "single pane of glass" view for decision-makers to analyze the journey from Gross Sales to Net Profit and take immediate action on underperforming products.

🚀 Key Features

Waterfall Financial Flow: Visualizes the impact of refunds, COGS, shipping, and ad spend on the final Net Profit ($97,445).

Automated Action Engine: A custom logic-driven table that categorizes SKUs as "Winners" to scale or "Money Pits" to stop, based on net margin performance.

Interactive Slicer UI: A modern, Indigo-themed interface allowing users to filter the entire dashboard by recommended action with one click.

Executive KPI Cards: High-contrast cards highlighting critical metrics like Store ROAS (128.93x) and Monthly Ad Waste ($18,928).

Dynamic Insight Banner: A smart text engine that calculates and displays the exact monthly savings achieved by following the dashboard's recommendations.

🛠️ Technical Stack

Data Modeling: Power Query used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of Orders, Products, and Marketing datasets.

Visualization: Advanced Excel charting, including Waterfall charts and custom shapes with linked cell values.

UI/UX Design: Dark-mode "SaaS" aesthetic using a Slate/Indigo color palette (#1E293B, #6366F1).

Logic: Complex DAX-style Excel formulas for conditional insight generation and performance tiering.

📈 Insights Summary

By analyzing the performance of 15+ SKUs, this tool identified that stopping ads on just 4 "Money Pit" SKUs (such as GENERIC-GADGET-6 and -7) would save the business approximately $18,928 per month.
